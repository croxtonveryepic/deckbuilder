todo:
high priority

medium priority:
    polish dark mode (cannot read filter dropdowns, some modals weird)
    modify the deck modal to allow browsing overlay cards
    deck zone indicators
        number of creatures, spells, locations, and weapons (will this even fit?)

medium priority:
code for soulful and soulless
modify the deck modal to allow browsing overlay cards

    fix pathing to be build env agnostic // currently using dev/master cherry-pick, which is fine
    manual dark mode switch
    proxies
    options for how to sort the deck
    deck codes, saving and importing features
    change background to something flawed themed
